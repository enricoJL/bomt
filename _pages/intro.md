# The title page of the Book of Mormon

<center>
> THE BOOK OF MORMON
> AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY
> THE HAND OF MORMON
</center>

Like I said earlier, you will find that this book contains a very personal testimony. This is the reason I call it the \emph{Book of My Testimony}. And it has been written by my own hands. Moroni, who wrote the title page of the Book of Mormon, wrote that the book has been written mostly by his father Mormon, even though he wrote the last pages of it. 

Moroni states in the first paragraph of his title page that the \emph{Book of Mormon} was ``Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation'' (first paragraph). Likewise, I was impressed by the Spirit to begin to write this book. I started it on my mission in Post Falls (Idaho) and I continued in the years that followed. This account that I wrote is a true personal revelation from God. 

%Of course I don't have the boldness to claim it to be doctrinal to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, even if it may bring some lights to our believes. It can help to understand better and have a greater faith in the doings of God. 

While I was studying the scriptures and at other times in my life, I received a certain number of revelations from God. I am not a prophet for the Church and I don't profess to be such a special witness, but I am a witness of God. I desire to express my faith high and loud. Let the reader enjoy this gift of the Spirit as another personal and modern testimony of the great doings of the Almighty.

	Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever\ldots\hspace{1pt} (second paragraph)
\end{quote}  

My goal with this book is likewise to show to my children (whom also can be considered a remnant of the House of Israel) what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers. This is such a great comfort for us, children of Israel, by adoption or by blood, to know that we are not cast off forever. The Lord has blessed our father Jacob and has given him a new name, a place with Isaac and Abraham in the kingdom of heaven. He, the God of Abraham, will forever bless his servants. Because of the assurance of the promises he gave to our fathers, due to their great faith and fidelity to the gospel of the Lamb, we can trust in the covenants of the Lord to our fathers. 

We are given in our day this precious gospel of Christ contained in the \emph{Book of Mormon} and many other books like the \emph{Bible}. We can trust with all our heart, mind and soul that the Living God never gives up, that his promises are sure. The Book of Mormon is a testimony of that. I too have been promised great things from the mouth of his servants. I have been promised that my children will be raised in knowledge and truth, in wisdom and spirit, and the Spirit told me once that they will always be protected by the hand of the Lord. Those promises to me are as precious as my own life.

My Catholic mother received also a similar promise reading the Bible. She told me that the Spirit of God told her one day that all her children will eventually be adopted of the Lord. The Almighty God through his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, has given me so much to hang on to, has raised me in knowledge and truth, has given me a hand of principles and directives to guide my life to security and peace. We are not cast off forever. The Good Shepherd is calling us, children of Israel and all the nations of the earth, to gather in the pastures of eternal life.

	And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations\ldots\hspace{1pt} (second paragraph)
\end{quote}

This is the very testimony I received from the Holy Spirit the first time I read the words of Nephi in the Book of Mormon. This prophet more than all the others helped me to understand more clearly who is Jesus the Christ and truly convinced me of his divinity. I found that Jesus is the Almighty, the Great I Am, the Only Begotten in the flesh, and that he was sacrificed for the benefit of all of us mortals. He earned to be considered our Lord and Savior. Because of Him, I have been healed in my mind and in my heart, by the virtue of his atonement. I found the strength and the inspiration to live righteously. I have come closer to the Father and I look forward to come with Him in the celestial realm. This book of my testimony adds another witness along the words of the prophets. It may nourish the believer in his search for inspirational thoughts, as it did for me.

\begin{quote}
	And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God\ldots (second paragraph)
\end{quote}

There are lots of faults in this record that I have made, as the prophets of old did. Please don't condemn me. I try hard to clarify my thoughts and the doctrine I refer to, but there are a lot that I can't express and even more that I cannot understand yet. All I really want is to make my personal testimony known unto my children to motivate them and others to read the scriptures and believe in God, likening the scriptures to their own lives as the prophets did. These prophets became my friends regardless of their imperfections.

\begin{quote}
	Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: ``I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.'' (fifth paragraph)
\end{quote}

I took that statement to heart and began to search for God, and I pushed myself to write my inspirations on my journey. This adventure of likening the Book of Mormon to myself, especially the two books of Nephi, son of Lehi, has brought me closer to the Spirit than any thing else I had experienced prior. So far, I have written thoughts only regarding those two books of Nephi. This is what you will find in the \emph{Book of My Testimony}. Those books, as I will show you, contain the fullness of the gospel. I wish I could tell you the same thing about my own book, and that it is the ``most correct of any book on earth'', but of course I can't, for there are so many good and better books; but I can tell you that I've been true and faithful in writing all the words that it contains. 

``Believe in God; believe that he is\ldots'' (Mosiah 4:8) said another Book of Mormon prophet. This is what I would like to tell the whole world if I could. I want to show that he is, that he has always been there and that he, through his Son, will forever be our Redeemer and our Great Provider.

\section*{THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The testimony of three witnesses}

\begin{quote}
	Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi\ldots\hspace{1pt} And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true\ldots\hspace{1pt} And it is marvelous to our eyes\ldots\hspace{1pt} 
\end{quote}

I read this testimony for the first time while I was on a trip on Vancouver Island, on summer 1993, but I wasn't able to pay enough attention at the time to what I was reading. My mind was darkened with many troubles and my heart was feeling so heavy. I just couldn't concentrate. But on February 1994, after the missionaries had come to my apartment, as I was reading the introduction of this book again, the testimony of these men sank deep in my heart and soul. 

I was a bit skeptical at first about this story of men seeing angels, but when I read this honest testimony, and learning that God himself talked to them, it gave me confidence somehow. If I couldn't believe at the time that God could really talk to a man as a human voice can be heard with our ears, at least I trusted the honesty of those men. I knew they were saying the truth and they were not lying. Even if I couldn't believe literally all that they were saying, their testimony, with the impression it left on my mind, gave me enough assurance to begin reading the book and find out for myself if it could be true. I found the record of the Book of Mormon to be good to my soul, and later, the Holy Ghost gave me a sure knowledge of its truth. 

Hopefully, it will be the same for you as you read the pages of this book. It contains many experiences and also very personal thoughts. The Lord has talked to me many times and his Holy Spirit gave me much insights on many matters. I understand these things are very sacred, but I write them that it may never be forgotten, either by myself or my children or others. I am aware that many, including my close ones, may be very skeptical about the things I write; as I was myself about the testimony of those three witnesses; but I can assure you that I have been very careful to give a scrupulous account of my spiritual experiences as they came to me, doing my very best to not distort any thing and to be as clear and precise as words can be.

\section*{THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The testimony of eight witnesses}

\begin{quote}
	Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold\ldots\hspace{1pt} And we lie not, God bearing witness of it\ldots 
\end{quote}

``And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.'' This is also what I tell the people. I am not a liar. What you will find in this book is absolutely true. These are my thoughts, impressions and believes. I cannot lie on them; and I will not. I feel as my salvation depends on the truthfulness of my testimony. I feel a solemn duty to also live my life in accordance with what I have been ordained to teach. Like those men have given their names, I want to give my name and my life as a witness to this new doctrine that God has restored through the prophet Joseph Smith Jun. 

I trust in the witness of those men and in the testimony of Joseph Smith; but more fully I trust in my God and in the whispering of his Holy Spirit. A man may lie if he pleases but he cannot make God, the Man of Holiness, lie. It takes great confidence in what may have been experienced to declare in soberness that God himself will witness of its truth. The test is then put on the reader's responsibility to humble himself and seek divine inspiration as to find out if it is a true witness. God will witness of the truth. 

I am satisfied with the witness from God I received of the Book of Mormon and I am confident that the Holy Spirit will also guide you as you read these words. He will confirm to your heart and soul the truth of my words, as also he will help you discern my weaknesses. If I may give you a piece of advice: trust in God over anything else; he is your Father and he knows better. A man may be inspired of God to direct another, if he has such power given him from God; in this case, as in this Testimony of Eight Witnesses, God will always confirm it by the power of his Spirit or by his own voice. There are such things in God's kingdom and wisdom that are considered to be so important to necessitate his intervention. So, be sure he will intervene to help any of his children to come closer to him and understand better who he really is. I think my book helps to go further in that direction, as any true living testimony of the divinity does.

\section*{TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Testimony of the prophet Joseph Smith}

\begin{quote}
	While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor\ldots

	He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do\ldots 

	He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;

	Also, that there were two stones in silver bows --- and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim --- deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted Seers in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book. (3rd, 5th to 7th paragraphs)
\end{quote}

An angel of light came down from heaven to give directives and knowledge to a young man, commanding him in the name of God to do a marvelous work for the good of the children of men. He was to translate by the power of God an ancient record carved on gold plates hidden in a stone box covered with dirt. This is how the \emph{Book of Mormon} was brought to us, by the appearance of a man from heaven to a man of the earth, the holy one guiding the other. Do we really believe that such things could happen to us? Since I heard that story, I sought for those kinds of events in my life. 

Well, let me tell you right away that I never saw an angel with my eyes, and I never received a commandment first hand from any being coming down from heaven. This \emph{Book of My Testimony} though has been on my mind for many years, written and hidden in a card board box where I had put the first drafts, like the Book of Mormon was hidden in a stone box by Moroni, except that it was not kept that many years. No messenger from heaven came to command me to write this book, but friends of mine have encouraged me to write something good from this first drafts; also the Spirit of God pushes me to write my experiences and convinced me that it could be of any worth.
