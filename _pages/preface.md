A little about myself
-------------

I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I first met a member of the church when I was 21 years old while visiting Victoria, British Columbia. That's when I heard the story of Joseph Smith for the first time. I later met the missionaries of the church in Montreal and began studying with them. After some time, I desired to be baptized to receive the remission of my sins and become a better man, a disciple of Christ.

I live in the province of Quebec, Canada, and have lived there all my life, except for two years (1998-2000) when I served in the Spokane Washington Mission, in the United States of America, as a true representative of Jesus Christ.

During my mission, I started writing down my impressions of the Book of Mormon and sharing some experiences from my life that were related to what I read in the scriptures. I continued writing these thoughts for a while after my mission. These impressions, thoughts, and experiences have been a source of spiritual reinforcement for me. I decided to edit this journal and turn it into a book, which I named The Book of My Testimony.

What is contained in this book?
-------------

<!-- need to give more explanation -->
You will find in this book my personal impressions of the Book of Mormon. I start with the first book of Nephi, who was the first prophet to write in the Book of Mormon. I share many spiritual experiences and thoughts that relate to each verse of the scriptures. It is like a journal and it contains a very personal testimony of the things of God I have seen in my life. It is also a good companion for the study of the Book of Mormon, as it teaches how one person can read and apply the words of the prophets to himself.

This book is a testimony of truth. I share how I came to believe in the existence of God, how I came to know the Book of Mormon and was convinced of the gospel of Jesus Christ contained within it and in other holy books like the Bible. I share visions and dreams and impressions and revelations that I received to guide me and to comfort me. I try to follow the example of the prophet Nephi and pattern my life after his. I also offer my humble interpretation of what we read in the Book of Mormon, as well as my questions and insights. Essentially, I share my faith, personal beliefs, and experiences with the truth I found by joining The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and serving my Lord and Savior over the years. It is not a light report, nor is it a heavy study. I am not a scholar; I am just a simple disciple of Christ who thinks it is worth writing his testimony of Christ, whom I love with all my heart, might, mind, and soul.

Part II of The Book of My Testimony will be about the second book of Nephi. These two books, the first and second books of Nephi, contain the fullness of the gospel of Christ and a clear explanation of the purposes of God. I surely hope that my comments will also help the reader understand the ways of the Lord.

The prophet Nephi wrote: 'for I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning' (1 Nephi 19:23). I wrote my words keeping this verse in mind, trying to liken each principle and point of doctrine to myself. It has been a great experience to seek what in my own life could resemble the experiences of the prophet Nephi and his family. The things I have written please my heart and help me feel the Holy Spirit of God. I hope they will have the same effect on you.

How to read this book?
-------------

This book is still in progress. I call it a book because I started it as a book and it may end as such, though it may take other formats along the way. What you can see now is what I have written so far. The continuation of it will be posted on this blog in sections until it is completed. Then we'll see where it takes us. There may be several mistakes and errors since I do my own editing, but please be patient and kind enough to point them out to me. Your comments are more than welcome.

You may want to read this book alongside the Book of Mormon, but it is not absolutely necessary to do so because I quote all the words from the scriptures that you need to understand the context in this book.

The Book of My Testimony is divided into two parts. Each chapter corresponds to a chapter in the Book of Mormon and each section of those chapters corresponds to a verse. In Part I, Chapter 1 corresponds to Chapter 1 of the first book of Nephi. In Part II, which will be another book, Chapter 1 will correspond to Chapter 1 of the second book of Nephi. For each verse, I share how I apply the words and principles to my life. I share my understanding of what I read and my personal testimony of the truths that I have experienced myself. I share true stories related loosely to the scriptures. Some stories take more than one section, so if you feel you missed something, try reading the sections before the one you are reading to see if you can reach the beginning of the story.

I try to be as specific and clear as I can for all kinds of readers. Though it may seem to be written for people of my own faith, it is also intended to provide a real-life experience with what I think are universal truths. If you don't like what you read for some reason, feel free to skip that part and go somewhere else, or simply welcome this other view for what it is: another view. But if you like what you read and have some time, please let me know – it's always good to have some feedback.

Most of the books I refer to can be found online (\url{www.churchofjesuschrist.org}) or at our Church Distribution Center. I refer to books in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants (D\&C), and the Pearl of Great Price. If you don't know the specific book I am referring to, it is probably in one of these other books.
