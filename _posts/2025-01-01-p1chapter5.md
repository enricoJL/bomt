***Likening [chapter 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5?lang=eng) of the first book of Nephi***


## 1 Nephi 5:1-3

> And it came to pass that after we had come down into the wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.

> For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man...

> And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father.

When I went back to Montreal after my two year mission, my father came at the airport to take me. My sister was there also with her family, my branch president and some of my friends too.  It was a happy reunion.  I felt my father was still proud of me and I was glad to see my friends and family.  

My mother was living too far away to come to Montreal, so my father let me borrow his car to go visit her in Gaspésie.  She was filled with joy when she saw me.  She told me she was very pleased with all the letters I had sent to her.  I wrote to her every week while on my mission.  

It was great to see them all.  

My mother lost her father while I was gone.  I told her I was sorry for not being there.  Since we talked over the phone on the occasion, she said she was fine with that.  


## 1 Nephi 5:4-6

> And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying: I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren.

> But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.

> And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.

I have personally received great promises from the Lord, and He has kept His word so far. I am deeply grateful to know Him and to serve Him. Through trials, I have learned to trust in God and remain at peace. He has blessed me in many ways, and I will continue to rely on His guiding hand.

When I am down, He comforts me. When I am weak, He strengthens me. He watches over me, my family, and those for whom I pray. My faith remains in the character and the works of the resurrected Savior, and in the hope that He will one day come again on Earth to reign with greatness and majesty.

Like Lehi of old, I can say: “I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision, I should not have known the goodness of God…” He is loving and merciful. He cares for us. I know this. I bear witness of it. And I will continue to speak of Him.

It is my hope that this book adds to that testimony.
