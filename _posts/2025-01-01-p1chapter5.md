***Likening [chapter 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5?lang=eng) of the first book of Nephi***


## 1 Nephi 5:1-3

> And it came to pass that after we had come down into the wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.

> For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man...

> And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father.

When I went back to Montreal after my two year mission, my father came at the airport to take me. My sister was there also with her family, my branch president and some of my friends too.  It was a happy reunion.  I felt my father was still proud of me and I was glad to see my friends and family.  

My mother was living too far away to come to Montreal, so my father let me borrow his car to go visit her in Gaspésie.  She was filled with joy when she saw me.  She told me she was very pleased with all the letters I had sent to her.  I wrote to her every week while on my mission.  

It was great to see them all.  

My mother lost her father while I was gone.  I told her I was sorry for not being there.  Since we talked over the phone on the occasion, she said she was fine with that.  


## 1 Nephi 5:4-5

> And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying: I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren.

> But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.

I have personally received great promises from the Lord, and He has kept His word so far. I am deeply grateful to know Him and to serve Him. Through trials, I have learned to trust in God and remain at peace. He has blessed me in many ways, and I will continue to rely on His guiding hand.

When I am down, He comforts me. When I am weak, He strengthens me. He watches over me, my family, and those for whom I pray. My faith remains in the character and the works of the resurrected Savior, and in the hope that He will one day come again on Earth to reign with greatness and majesty.

Like Lehi of old, I can say: “I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision, I should not have known the goodness of God…” He is loving and merciful. He cares for us. I know this. I bear witness of it. And I will continue to speak of Him.

It is my hope that this book adds to that testimony.


## 1 Nephi 5:6-7

> And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.

> And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.

In July 1994, when I told my mother that I was going to be baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she was deeply worried. She feared I was going to joined a strange and obscure cult. Her concern was genuine and intense. Providentially, the day after my baptism, I had the chance to travel with friends to Matane, where she lived, on my way to the Baie-des-Chaleurs in Gaspésie.

When I visited her, I wanted to help her understand my new faith. So I sat with her and read from the Book of Mormon—a passage that recounts the visit of the resurrected Christ to a remnant of Israel’s descendants in the ancient Americas. In this sacred account, God the Father introduces His Beloved Son to the people, and Christ teaches them, much as He did during His mortal ministry in Palestine.

As I read aloud, the words of scripture brought the Spirit into the room. My mother felt something. The Holy Ghost began to testify of the truthfulness of what I was sharing. The moment became especially powerful when I read this verse from [3 Nephi 11:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p3#p3):

> And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.

As we read those words together, our hearts began to burn. We felt the love of God. My mother started to feel peace and reassurance. When I then read the Savior’s words in [3 Nephi 11:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p10#p10):

> Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.

—she rejoiced. With gladness, she exclaimed how wonderful it was that we believed in Jesus Christ. She said she believed this new religion was good and that it truly came from God.

It was a great relief to me.

The inspired words of the Father, the Son, and the prophet Nephi helped my mother feel the witness of the Holy Spirit—and her fears began to subside.

> And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.
