***Likening the [chapter 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng) of the first book of Nephi***

## 1 Nephi 3:1

> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father.

Sometimes I long to connect with the Lord through prayer. My prayers aren't always heartfelt and authentic, but when they are, the comfort I receive is considerable. I have faced many challenges and complex situations in life that have left me feeling anxious and powerless. In those moments, I have placed my trust in the tender mercies of the Lord, knowing that He would always be there to support and guide me. Through prayer, I have been able to find the courage and motivation to continue doing what is right, even when I have felt discouraged. Speaking with the Lord in prayer, I am moved and inspired to stay on the path of righteousness.

## 1 Nephi 3:2

> And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.

As a prophet and spiritual leader, Lehi received commandments from the Lord for his family. Similarly, our mission president received and gave directives in the name of the Lord to us missionaries. He was inspired to send me to serve in Post Falls, Idaho, Libby, Montana, and Orofino, Idaho.

Before I left for the Spokane Washington Mission, when he learned that North Idaho was part of the territory covered by this mission, my branch president in Montreal asked me to find the missionary who baptized him. He gave me his name, hoping that in the mercy of God, I would find him.

After a year and a half in my mission, I had completely forgotten about the request. However, in the last area I was sent to by my mission president, I presented myself in front of the Kamiah Ward in Idaho, and I mentioned that I was from Montreal. After the meeting, a brother approached me and asked if I knew a man he baptized long ago when he served his mission in Montreal. I told him that he was my branch president. The two friends were able to contact each other through me. Nobody but God could have arranged such an unlikely meeting.

## 1 Nephi 3:3

> For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.


The history of the Jews was kept on metal plates to preserve it from year to year. Lehi was also commanded to keep his history and the language of his forefathers. Nephi and his descendants continued to keep these records, which ultimately led to the creation of the *Book of Mormon*. I also keep a diary in my journal, and I am writing this *Book of My Testimony* to help my children understand who I am and what God has done for me. This is extremely important to me, and I hope it will be for my descendants as well.

Upon joining The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was encouraged to bring my genealogy to the temple and perform baptisms for my ancestors. However, before doing so, I needed to gather the names, birth dates, and marriage dates of my ancestors. Thankfully, I was able to consult with my grandmothers and their sisters, and on my mother's side, I was provided with a book containing all the necessary information. On my father's side, I was given books written containing the genealogy of my forefathers. Armed with this information, I began preparing and researching my genealogy. Today, with the advent of the internet, this process is even easier. People from all around the world contribute information to help us find our deceased ancestors.

## 1 Nephi 3:4

> Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.

## 1 Nephi 3:5

> And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.

<!--When we received from him the directive to arrange our agenda to spend more time teaching in the evening, because it meant to change a few habits we had, missionaries and members, it was hard to accept. Some of us were tempted to complain about it.-->
