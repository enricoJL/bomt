***Likening the [chapter 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng) of the first book of Nephi***

## 1 Nephi 3:1

> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father.

Sometimes I long to connect with the Lord through prayer. My prayers aren't always heartfelt and authentic, but when they are, the comfort I receive is considerable. I have faced many challenges and complex situations in life that have left me feeling anxious and powerless. In those moments, I have placed my trust in the tender mercies of the Lord, knowing that He would always be there to support and guide me. Through prayer, I have been able to find the courage and motivation to continue doing what is right, even when I have felt discouraged. Speaking with the Lord in prayer, I am moved and inspired to stay on the path of righteousness.

## 1 Nephi 3:2

> And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.

As a prophet and spiritual leader, Lehi received commandments from the Lord for his family. Similarly, our mission president received and gave directives in the name of the Lord to us missionaries. He was inspired to send me to serve in Idaho and Montana.

Before I left for the Spokane Washington Mission, when he learned that North Idaho was part of the territory covered by this mission, my branch president in Montreal asked me to find the missionary who baptized him. He gave me his name, hoping that in the mercy of God, I would find him.

After a year and a half in my mission, I had completely forgotten about the request. However, in the last area I was sent to by my mission president, I presented myself in front of the Kamiah Ward in Idaho, and I mentioned that I was from Montreal. After the meeting, a brother approached me and asked if I knew a man he baptized long ago when he served his mission in Montreal. I told him that he was my branch president. The two friends were able to contact each other through me. Nobody but God could have arranged such an unlikely meeting.

## 1 Nephi 3:3

> For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.

The history of the Jews was kept on metal plates to preserve it from year to year. Lehi was also commanded to keep his history and the language of his forefathers. Nephi and his descendants continued to keep these records, which ultimately led to the creation of the *Book of Mormon*. I also keep a diary in my journal, and I am writing this *Book of My Testimony* to help my children understand who I am and what God has done for me. This is extremely important to me, and I hope it will be for my descendants as well.

Upon joining The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was encouraged to bring my genealogy to the temple and perform baptisms for my ancestors. However, before doing so, I needed to gather the names, birth dates, and marriage dates of my ancestors. Thankfully, I was able to consult with my grandmothers and their sisters, and on my mother's side, I was provided with a book containing all the necessary information. On my father's side, I was given books written containing the genealogy of my forefathers. Armed with this information, I began preparing and researching my genealogy.

Today, with the advent of the internet, this process is even easier. People from all around the world contribute information to help us find our deceased ancestors.

## 1 Nephi 3:4

> Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.

Encouraged by my church Home Teacher to "seek the records" containing the names of my ancestors, as a new convert, I undertook once to go to my grandmother's place to get the certificates of my grandfather's birth, marriage, and death. She was living off the island of Montreal, and when you don't have a car, leaving the island is a considerable trip. After walking and riding subways and buses for two hours, when I finally got off the bus in Blainville where she lived, even though I had time to rest during the last ride, since it is hard for me to walk, I was exhausted and still in pain. But I needed to walk again quite a distance to get to my grandmother's house. It may have been in winter. The wind was blowing hard. I remember the cold wind blowing in my face, and each step was hard to take. I had to push hard against the wind. I was ready to get discouraged and I wondered if I could make it. I prayed to God for help to keep going, and I received confort and strength. The next thing I remember is walking near my grandmother's place to knock at her door to get in safely. I don't remember anything in between.

When I explained to my grandmother the reason I was asking for my deceased grandfather's papers, that it was to give him the opportunity in the temple to receive the same blessings I received in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so that we could be together as a family forever if he accepts, we were both filled with great love from the Spirit of God, and she exclaimed: "For sure, he will accept it!" We were both very happy.

I often wondered if my grandfather was not there, also at that time, helping from the other side, both to give me strength during the walk and to reassure my grandmother that it was a good thing to let me borrow the original papers to make photocopies.

## 1 Nephi 3:5

> And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.

After this experience at my grandmother's place, I began to do my genealogy, going to public libraries to research in books and records. A sister from the church helped me a lot. I was also given some other books from my family that helped me complete my first generations. With this, we were able to get to my ancestors who came from France to New France in America. But when it was time to prepare the names to bring them to the temple, I had to verify which ones had already been done in temples around the world using software called *TempleReady*. I had gathered some fifty or sixty names, and it took me some time to do it. I had their names, dates of birth, marriages, and children. Unfortunately, only a few of them had not already been done. I said "unfortunately" because I was not happy about that. I was frustrated and upset because if I had known that at first, I wouldn't have spent so much time searching for people who were already saved. I am sorry to admit that I murmured a lot.

Now, with the tools we have, and people freely sharing their lineages through the internet, as soon as we identify a person, we can know if the work has been done for them in temples. We can navigate through our generations and learn who we are. All of this is possible because some of us have done the will of God in gathering information about our ancestors and have provided resources to develop the necessary technology.

## 1 Nephi 3:6

> Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast not murmured.

This is what I felt my Father in heaven was telling me while I was serving in Libby, Montana, trying earnestly to spend more time teaching in the evening after the directive given to us by our mission president. I have truly been favored by the Lord because I have not murmured. This is the key to success: just do what is right with a joyful heart without murmuring. When we are humble, the Spirit of God can have full sway in our hearts and produce miracles.

Jesus Christ is asking His disciples in our days to go to the temple often to perform ordinances for their ancestors. We have been told by modern prophets that this work has tremendous importance for the salvation of the human race. The temple ordinances help us remember our covenants to do good in all aspects of our lives. Even if we can't see the people on the other side of the veil, many members of The Church of Jesus Christ spend a lot of time in temples with faith that the work done in there will be beneficial for some. We are blessed in many ways in the temple, especially with joy and happiness, and with the strength to do right and be good to others.

## 1 Nephi 3:7

> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.

An old brother in Troy, Montana told me once that when his father would ask something of him, he would do it right away without questioning. This is true love. I truly desire to develop such a trait of character. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments". ([John 14:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=15#14))

On my mission, our leaders have asked us to do things which we didn't think we could accomplish, perhaps due to a lack of faith. But the Lord has been there to bless us with success. When my mission president gave us the directive to eat dinner at members' places from 5 pm to 6 pm, we thought it would be hard to organize with the ward members. However, everyone willingly did their part, and it went very well. It was wonderful. We were able to work harder and focus more on teaching the Gospel. Our president was definitely inspired of God.

I also know that the Lord will always prepare a way for us to accomplish His commandments. He provided a way for me to save enough money to go on a two-year mission. He gave me the health and the strength to work hard everyday with my physical condition. I know He will do the same for everyone who desires to serve Him.

## 1 Nephi3:8

> And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord.

My own father once told me after my baptism that he trusted the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints more than any other church because he noticed the positive changes it brought in me. He saw my efforts to reconcile with him and to do good, and he recognized a significant change in my character. Even if he couldn't tell right away that it was coming from God, he could see in me the blessings of the Almighty.

## 1 Nephi 3:9

> And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.

When I was at the airport to depart for Salt Lake City, my father came to the airport to bid me farewell. He approached me and expressed how proud he was of me for taking the time to do good to others. He reiterated his sentiments over the phone a year later, while I was serving in Montana. As a son, it meant a great deal to me to hear my father express his satisfaction with me.

This was my second time traveling to the West Coast, but this time, it was not just to travel, it was for a greater purpose. I am grateful to God for enabling me to go.

## 1 Nephi 3:10

> And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.

It is crucial to engage in planning before attempting to undertake anything challenging, crucial, or complex. As missionaries, we frequently held planning sessions to ensure we were well-prepared and coordinated in our endeavors. I continue to do so in my work regularly.

## 1 Nephi 3:11

> And we cast lots—who of us should go in unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.

Although it may seem unusual to resort to casting lots to determine the will of God, my companion and I often played *Paper, Rock, Scissors* to decide who would teach, offer a blessing, or go somewhere when we both wished to do the same thing.

## 1 Nephi 3:12-14

> And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father. And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have the records. Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee. But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness.

Laman threatened to kill Laban and he failed to retrieve the brass plates. When Laban recounted Laman's threat to his brothers, they were all sorrowful. Nephi's brothers were even prepared to abandon their mission and return to the wilderness.

Once, in Post Falls, Idaho, we felt disheartened after spending time with a couple who began reading anti-Mormon literature. They became afraid of us and told us not to come back. Despite our discouragement, we persevered to do our work and went out to knock on doors. On that same day, we encountered a woman who accepted our teachings and was baptized a few months later. On another occasion, while teaching a young man in Libby, Montana whom I wasn't sure was sincere, I felt discouraged. However, he later began studying with us more earnestly, and we became friends. Similarly, when a man's friend spoke ill of us during a meeting, we continued testifying and reading from the Book of Mormon, and eventually, both individuals expressed a desire to attend church with us.

People are capable of changing, including their situations and circumstances. As a young man, I once believed that I could never change. However, after a few weeks in the Church of Jesus Christ, I realized that all the flaws I believed would take years to overcome had disappeared. Although my outward appearance remained the same, I felt like a new person inside. My perspective had shifted, and I began to trust that my future could be different.

Although life has been challenging at times, I now realize that I should have never lost hope because things truly did get better with God's help. Losing hope can be a deeply sorrowful experience and a lack of perspective can lead to feelings of despair. Unmet expectations can also be a source of pain. In fact, I believe that the discrepancy between what we expect and what actually occurs causes the most distress. A lack of faith can also lead to losing perspective and experiencing unnecessary stress. However, the Spirit of God often reassured me in my prayers, telling me that things would get better. With time, I learned to trust in God when He comforted me about the future. He promised me that He would always take care of me and my family, so there is no need to fear.

## 1 Nephi 3:15

>But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.



## 1 Nephi 3:16

> Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father’s inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments of the Lord.

## 1 Nephi 3:17

> For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people.

## 1 Nephi 3:18

> For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets. Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath been commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also perish. Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the land.

## 1 Nephi 3:19

> And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers;

## 1 Nephi 3:20

> And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.

## 1 Nephi 3:21

> And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God.

## 1 Nephi 3:22

> And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things.

## 1 Nephi 3:23

> And after we had gathered these things together, we went up again unto the house of Laban.

## 1 Nephi 3:24
> And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.

## 1 Nephi 3:25

> And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.

## 1 Nephi 3:26

> And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands of Laban.

## 1 Nephi 3:27

> And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock.

## 1 Nephi 3:28

> And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.

## 1 Nephi 3:29

> And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.

## 1 Nephi 3:30

> And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.

## 1 Nephi 3:31

> And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?
