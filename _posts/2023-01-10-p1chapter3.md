***Likening the [chapter 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng) of the first book of Nephi***

## 1 Nephi 3:1

> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father.

## 1 Nephi 3:2 

> And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.

## 1 Nephi 3:3 

> For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.

## 1 Nephi 3:4 

> Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.

## 1 Nephi 3:5 

> And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.
