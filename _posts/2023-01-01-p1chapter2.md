***Likening the second chapter of the first book of Nephi***

## 1 Nephi 2:1

> For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.

Lehi was a great example of complete submission to God, especially to his own family. Despite the consequences, he obeyed the Lord's command to go to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and prophecy to them about what he had seen in visions. As a result, he was blessed, although he almost lost his life in the process. In the following verses, the Lord gives Lehi even more commandments. In God's mind, blessings are often associated with directives on how to obtain those blessings. Whenever God speaks to a man, he always seems to give him something to do.

During my mission, I had a lot of rules and directives to follow. Every minute of the day and night, 7 days a week, for a full 24 months, I had to adhere to strict guidelines. Despite the challenges, it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. This chapter of the Book of Mormon I studied during that time helped me reflect on and clarify any misunderstandings or misguided thoughts I had about commandments and directives. It was a valuable tool for personal growth.

## 1 Nephi 2:2

> And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.

While preparing for my mission in Montreal, Canada, I struggled to prepare myself and convince my leaders that I could serve full-time despite my handicap. One day, my bishop had a dream in which he saw me on a wheelchair going door to door with my companion pushing me. When we stopped in front of a door, I stood up, knocked, and taught before returning to the wheelchair. My bishop shared this dream with me as he gave me the papers to fill out and submit to the Church headquarters. Previously, I had told him that I was even willing to serve full-time at the temple in Toronto if my condition didn't allow me to go on a regular proselyting mission. However, after he told me the dream, it became clear to both of us that the Lord wanted me in the mission field. Trusting in my bishop's inspiration and in the belief that God was in charge of my life, I eventually went to the Spokane Washington Mission with full confidence.

I believed that my mission president was also inspired by God and I made an effort to follow his directives, hoping to please God. During my mission, I often did things with the intention of pleasing God rather than people, and as a result, many lives were blessed because of it, including my own.

There were times when I struggled to obey the requests and commands of my mission president and other mission leaders. In hindsight, it seems clear that these directives were right, but at the time, it wasn't always easy for me to follow them. For example, my zone leader asked me to read the Book of Mormon more frequently with the people I visited in order to improve my statistics on the number of lessons taught and people invited to church. My mission president also directed me to eat with members from 5-6 pm and then go out on appointments from 6:30-9:30 pm, with the goal of getting three appointments per evening. Additionally, my mission president asked us to spend three consecutive days in our apartment reading the Book of Mormon. These were all directives that were challenging for me to understand or follow at the time, but as I obeyed, they brought blessings to my life and the lives of others.

I provide more information about these three situations in the following lines.

## 1 Nephi 2:3

> And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.
{: style="text-align: left"}

Nephi tells us that his father did what he did because "he was obedient unto the word of the Lord". Lehi was a true servant of the Lord and his example helped me when I was struggling with mission directives. I was serving in Libby, Montana and Bountiful, Idaho in the Sand Point Stake in the Rocky Mountains when I became the district leader of a small district of four missionaries. The scenery was beautiful, but we felt isolated and far from the other missionaries, as if we were in the middle of nowhere; "out there in the boonies", as a companion would say.

We were required to report on our work at the end of each week over the phone. We kept track of various metrics and had to report them to our immediate superior every Saturday night. We reported on the number of visits we made, the formal missionary discussions we had, and the non-members we met, among other things. These reports were affectionately known as the 'accounts'.

When I was transferred to Libby, the missionaries in the area were having three to four visits per week, which was low compared to the mission standard of thirty visits per week. We worked hard with my companions and the priesthood brethren in our units to increase the number of formal visits we made each week and to have a greater impact on the people we served.

I use the word 'formal' because not all of our visits were counted in our accounts. Only the visits where we presented the official discussions preparing people for membership the Church were counted. In addition, we also counted when we were able to read a full chapter of the Book of Mormon with a less active member, an active member, or a non-member. Member missionary visits, where we helped and encouraged members to share their beliefs with their friends and left them with specific things to do, were also acceptable too. 

A major source of frustration to me was that not all missionaries followed the same rules as to what to include in their reports; so some missionaries were having good reports while others did not, even if they were doing similar work. Personally, I did not like these reports because I felt they did not give an accurate portrayal of our work. I was also very strict about what could be counted and not counted, regardless of what my leaders thought. I told myself that I was working for the Lord and he knew what I was really doing.

Despite my strict attitude about my reports, after a few months we had reached around twelve or thirteen countable visits per week. I was proud of that, but it still wasn't enough for my zone leader. We discussed it over the phone. I explained that we were working hard and doing meaningful work, visiting people "out there in the boonies" every day. He asked me why it wasn't reflected in our reports. I responded bitterly, "Well, I can't count everything." I was angry because this was all volunteer work and I felt I had the right to do what I thought was best. I wasn't slacking on the job and I believed we were really helping those people by taking the time to address their concerns about their beliefs, religion, and God.

My zone leader then calmly suggested that my companion and I read a chapter of the Book of Mormon during informal visits so we could count them in our weekly reports. I was angry and struggled to stay calm. Reluctantly, I accepted because he was my leader and I wanted to respect him. It was hard for me to accept reprimands or directives that I felt I didn't need; it still is hard today, but I am getting better at it as time goes on.

## 1 Nephi 2:4

> And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness.
{: style="text-align: left"}

Lehi left his home in Jerusalem and all of his possessions to go into the wilderness, trusting in God's protection without knowing where he was going. He didn't question the Lord's guidance and simply left everything behind. He had a great vision and saw and felt many things about Jerusalem and its inhabitants, which may have helped to convince him to obey.

Serving a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is similar in that we leave behind everything, including our families, work, and friends. When I decided to go on a mission, my family thought I was foolish for leaving everything for the Church. They initially tried to discourage me from going. 

I felt overwhelmed when I listened to my zone leader in the mission field telling me to do more. I needed help understanding his perspective because I felt like I had already given everything I had. He took the time and made the effort to convince me to read a full chapter of the Book of Mormon with each person I visited, if possible. Initially, I was hesitant when he asked this of me, as it felt like a harsh command, although he was kind in his approach. Despite my reservations, I obediently followed his directive and it ended up blessing me and many other people as our teachings became more successful. 

As it turned out, submitting to this directive from my immediate leader was a blessing. I had started using my morning studies to liken the Book of Mormon to myself and apply the verses to the situations I was in, so it was easy for me to relate our readings to the situations of the people I was visiting. I would testify and share personal experiences and strong feelings related to what we were reading, and then encourage them to share their own thoughts. Because I was doing this exercise every morning and writing it down in a notebook, I had plenty of insights to fuel meaningful conversations about the messages of the Book of Mormon.

The Spirit of God blessed us many times with peace, light, and truth during these visits. The only challenge was fitting the reading of a whole chapter, along with insights and personal testimonies from everyone --- missionaries, regular members, and investigators --- within an hour-long visit, which was another rule of the mission that wasn't always followed, particularly by me; but that is a story for another time. While I did make progress in following this rule, I never fully managed to adhere to it.

## 1 Nephi 2:5

> And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

What a great leader Lehi was! His whole family followed him into the wilderness, even though they may not have fully understood or believed in all the things he did. His wife and children followed him in complete submissiveness. Lehi must have shared with them about his visions, the burning fire he saw, the book he read, and his belief in the Lord and His judgments. While not all of his family members believed him (Laman and Lemuel did not), they still left behind their possessions to follow him, including the skeptics. Now that is amazing! What kind of power could do such a thing? I believe it is true love. When a father does everything in his power to bless and support his family, it can be strong enough to earn the respect and love of his wife and children. This is how I feel towards those in positions of authority over me who sincerely love and respect me, such as my mission president, zone leader, bishop, and the general authorities (even if these last ones may not know me personally). In my heart, I find the desire to follow those I know love me. It must have been the same for Lehi's family.

Our mission president and his assistants once organized an event that we later called the Charity Conference. After giving us the usual instructions, all 50 missionaries gathered in one room. Our president sat in a corner, took off his jacket and prepared to serve us by taking out a brush, rags, wax of various tints, and other materials to polish our shoes. The assistants then announced that we would have a testimony meeting on the theme of charity. We were invited to come to the front and share our experiences of charity, while our president polished our shoes one by one in the front right corner of the room. It was a very powerful spiritual meeting, and many of us had tears in our eyes. It was also slightly awkward to see our president kneeling on the floor in front of us, sweating as he worked on our shoes.

I don't remember much of what was said at that meeting, but I do remember what our president said at the end, after he had finished polishing the last pair of shoes. He said that he had polished the shoes of all the missionaries in the mission, more than 200 pairs in total, and that it was easy to do. He then said that if he could do more for us, he would. I had no doubt about it because he was always so mindful of us, doing his best to support and accompany us in various ways.

Polishing our shoes was a very unique and symbolic action that showed us just how much he cared for each one of us. He said that this was nothing compared to what Christ has done for us, and then he spoke about Christ's love and the even greater love of the Father. At that moment, I knew that my Heavenly Father was also ready to do anything for me. My mission president had a great love for us, and it helped me to follow his directives. In the same way, knowing that my Heavenly Father has an infinite love for me, demonstrated by the gift of His Only Begotten Son for all of us, helps me to follow His commandments.

At that moment, Christ's atonement became for me a symbol of His love and the love of Heavenly Father. His atonement demonstrates that He and our Heavenly Father will continue to love us from the bottom of eternity to its end (which has no end). Their actions in the past and what has been prophesied for future generations clearly show how much they love all the children of men. And since God is always the same, we can be confident that our faith in Him and in the gift of His Son is not in vain, that His will is truly to bless us and not to condemn us.
