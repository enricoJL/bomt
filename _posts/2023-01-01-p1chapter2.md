***Likening the second chapter of the first book of Nephi***

## 1 Nephi 2:1

> For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.

Lehi was a great example of complete submission to God, especially to his own family. Despite the consequences, he obeyed the Lord's command to go to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and prophecy to them about what he had seen in visions. As a result, he was blessed, although he almost lost his life in the process. In the following verses, the Lord gives Lehi even more commandments. In God's mind, blessings are often associated with directives on how to obtain those blessings. Whenever God speaks to a man, he always seems to give him something to do.

During my mission, I had a lot of rules and directives to follow. Every minute of the day and night, 7 days a week, for a full 24 months, I had to adhere to strict guidelines. Despite the challenges, it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. This chapter of the Book of Mormon I studied during that time helped me reflect on and clarify any misunderstandings or misguided thoughts I had about commandments and directives. It was a valuable tool for personal growth.

## 1 Nephi 2:2

> And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.

While preparing for my mission in Montreal, Canada, I struggled to prepare myself and convince my leaders that I could serve full-time despite my handicap. One day, my bishop had a dream in which he saw me on a wheelchair going door to door with my companion pushing me. When we stopped in front of a door, I stood up, knocked, and taught before returning to the wheelchair. My bishop shared this dream with me as he gave me the papers to fill out and submit to the Church headquarters. Previously, I had told him that I was even willing to serve full-time at the temple in Toronto if my condition didn't allow me to go on a regular proselyting mission. However, after he told me the dream, it became clear to both of us that the Lord wanted me in the mission field. Trusting in my bishop's inspiration and in the belief that God was in charge of my life, I eventually went to the Spokane Washington Mission with full confidence.

I believed that my mission president was also inspired by God and I made an effort to follow his directives, hoping to please God. During my mission, I often did things with the intention of pleasing God rather than people, and as a result, many lives were blessed because of it, including my own.

There were times when I struggled to obey the requests and commands of my mission president and other mission leaders. In hindsight, it seems clear that these directives were right, but at the time, it wasn't always easy for me to follow them. For example, my zone leader asked me to read the Book of Mormon more frequently with the people I visited in order to improve my statistics on the number of lessons taught and people invited to church. My mission president also directed me to eat with members from 5-6 pm and then go out on appointments from 6:30-9:30 pm, with the goal of getting three appointments per evening. Additionally, my mission president asked us to spend three consecutive days in our apartment reading the Book of Mormon. These were all directives that were challenging for me to understand or follow at the time, but as I obeyed, they brought blessings to my life and the lives of others.

I will provide more information about these three situations in this chapter.

## 1 Nephi 2:3

> And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.

Nephi tells us that his father did what he did because "he was obedient unto the word of the Lord". Lehi was a true servant of the Lord and his example helped me when I was struggling with mission directives. I was serving in Libby, Montana and Bountiful, Idaho in the Sand Point Stake in the Rocky Mountains when I became the district leader of a small district of four missionaries. The scenery was beautiful, but we felt isolated and far from the other missionaries, as if we were in the middle of nowhere; "out there in the boonies", as a companion would say.

We were required to report on our work at the end of each week over the phone. We kept track of various metrics and had to report them to our immediate superior every Saturday night. We reported on the number of visits we made, the formal missionary discussions we had, and the non-members we met, among other things. These reports were affectionately known as the 'accounts'.

When I was transferred to Libby, the missionaries in the area were having three to four visits per week, which was low compared to the mission standard of thirty visits per week. We worked hard with my companions and the priesthood brethren in our units to increase the number of formal visits we made each week and to have a greater impact on the people we served.

I use the word 'formal' because not all of our visits were counted in our accounts. Only the visits where we presented the official discussions preparing people for membership the Church were counted. In addition, we also counted when we were able to read a full chapter of the Book of Mormon with a less active member, an active member, or a non-member. Member missionary visits, where we helped and encouraged members to share their beliefs with their friends and left them with specific things to do, were also acceptable too. 

A major source of frustration to me was that not all missionaries followed the same rules as to what to include in their reports; so some missionaries were having good reports while others did not, even if they were doing similar work. Personally, I did not like these reports because I felt they did not give an accurate portrayal of our work. I was also very strict about what could be counted and not counted, regardless of what my leaders thought. I told myself that I was working for the Lord and he knew what I was really doing.

Despite my strict attitude about my reports, after a few months we had reached around twelve or thirteen countable visits per week. I was proud of that, but it still wasn't enough for my zone leader. We discussed it over the phone. I explained that we were working hard and doing meaningful work, visiting people "out there in the boonies" every day. He asked me why it wasn't reflected in our reports. I responded bitterly, "Well, I can't count everything." I was angry because this was all volunteer work and I felt I had the right to do what I thought was best. I wasn't slacking on the job and I believed we were really helping those people by taking the time to address their concerns about their beliefs, religion, and God.

My zone leader then calmly suggested that my companion and I read a chapter of the Book of Mormon during informal visits so we could count them in our weekly reports. I was angry and struggled to stay calm. Reluctantly, I accepted because he was my leader and I wanted to respect him. It was hard for me to accept reprimands or directives that I felt I didn't need; it still is hard today, but I am getting better at it as time goes on.
