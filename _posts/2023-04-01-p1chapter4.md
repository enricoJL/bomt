***Likening [chapter 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng) of the first book of Nephi***



## 1 Nephi 4:1

> And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?

As Nephi did before, he once again encouraged his brothers to follow the Lord and believe that anything is possible for the Almighty God, who is mightier than any one. Personally, I have seen His powerful hand bless me, and also many others.

I have been guided by His Spirit, just like Nephi did, and have been able to navigate through difficult times and misfortunes with the assurance that God is always there to help. I have experienced some mighty miracles in my life, which might not always be what you would expect. However, His interventions have been evident to me many times, even though they might be invisible to others. There were even moments when people around me noticed that there was an invisible force working for me.

Due to the undeniable presence of God in my life and the profound impact of His wisdom and guidance, I could no longer ignore His existence. It was through experiencing His mighty hand that I truly started to believe in God, fulfilling my heartfelt desire to know Him. His divine intervention has rescued me from spiritual, psychological, and physical perils.

## 1 Nephi 4:2

> Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither...

After a month of being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I realized that I had changed more than I ever thought I would be able to in my life. My mind had changed, and my ability to interact with people had improved. My hopes were greater, and my happiness was more steadfast. I considered life as a great adventure, full of opportunities to seize. I was able to express myself with much more confidence, and I felt the love of God continually. I remember thinking it was a miracle in my case because of so many unsuccessful attempts to be more agreeable to others. Prior to my baptism, I had become very cynical, and I didn't think I was able to change my attitude about so many things. I had already become a better man, and this happened within just a month. Even so, my family started to notice it too, and my friends didn't recognize me. They were worried, though, that I had been brainwashed. I would tell them that it was perhaps a very necessary cleansing.

In February 1999, after serving as a missionary for nine months, during a worldwide satellite broadcast, our beloved prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, made the following statement:

"Last year there were approximately 300,000 convert baptisms throughout the Church. This is tremendously significant. This is the equivalent of 120 new stakes of 2,500 members each. Think of that: 120 new stakes in a single year! It is wonderful. But it is not enough. I am not being unrealistic when I say that with concerted effort, with recognition of the duty which falls upon each of us as members of the Church, and with sincere prayer to the Lord for help, we could double that number."

This powerful statement left a deep impression on my mind. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I constantly questioned how I could become a better missionary.

By early July of the same year, after having remained in Libby, Montana for some time, my companion and I received news that neither of us was being transferred. In our mission, new missionaries arrived every four weeks and needed to be paired with more experienced companions for training. Existing companionships were also regularly rearranged, and missionaries were shifted to different areas throughout the mission. Each transfer day was a mix of anticipation and apprehension. We had been together for four months, my companion and I, and I was anticipating a transfer. However, since it didn't happen, I began to contemplate how I could improve my efforts. The counsel to make "concerted efforts" remained on my mind. It became clear to me that I needed to learn how to work more effectively with local members and guide them in doing missionary work.

Other missionaries in my district had recently proposed using the announcement of the new Spokane, Washington temple as an opportunity to encourage members to invite their friends to attend the open house scheduled before its dedication in late August. We urged the members to invite their friends and bring them to Spokane, a three-hour drive away, to visit the new temple. We prepared the invitations, discussed the plan frequently, made some goals, and invited both members and non-members to attend the open house.

Something remarkable occurred during this time: we discovered the power of "concerted efforts" as both missionaries and local members worked together. The Spirit of God was with us, and we all experienced a profound sense of joy. After the open house, we continued to think about other ways to invite members to participate in the missionary effort, encouraging members to pray and invite their friends to hear the Gospel.

My companion was eventually transferred out of the area. I remained and became a zone leader. I exhorted all the missionaries in my zone to set goals for working with members and finding people to teach. We set a goal to double our baptisms that year and prayed for guidance from the Spirit of God. We shared our vision with the local church leaders, supported with the statement made by our prophet, and started working more closely.

Towards the end of the year, during a meeting with all the missionaries in my zone, we collectively reviewed the progress of the individuals we were teaching. We discussed those who had the potential to be baptized by the year's end. It became evident that the Elders in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, were lacking sufficient individuals seriously interested in the Gospel to reach our target. I advised them to pray for divine guidance in finding a family of five people, insisting that this was essential to double their baptisms. In time, they were able to locate and baptize that family before the year concluded.

I emphasized the importance of the numbers, but they weren't the sole focus. The numbers were there to guide us in understanding the extent of the work that needed to be accomplished and to offer us a shared vision for discussion. The ultimate goal was to lead as many people as possible to Christ through the act of baptism.

When we reached the combined zone conference on December 16th of that same year, we had indeed doubled our baptisms for the entire zone. We were all filled with happiness. We had started the year as the lowest-baptizing zone in the mission and ended it as the best. The other missionaries in my zone made me realize what a significant accomplishment it was, and they were very proud of me as their leader, but I knew that it was the work of the Lord.

I learned that year how efficient we may become in the Lord's work listening to the living prophet and following the promptings of the Holy Ghost.

## 1 Nephi 4:3

> Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers...

Here is a message to my children and anyone who may read these words: believe me when I say that the Lord has the power to assist you in your challenges, just as He did for me and countless others. He responded to my prayers and provided inspiration on numerous occasions, helping me understand the truth of the Book of Mormon, guiding me through tough situations, and even rescuing me from circumstances I could not handle on my own.

As you may already know if you're familiar with me (or if you've read the beginning of this book), I experienced a severe car accident at the age of seven that left me partially paralyzed. Consequently, it has been exceedingly challenging for me to navigate my life while striving for success in my endeavors. Because I was a car accident victime, I thought I could receive some help from the insurance state company, but when I required support to continue my education after college since I couldn't work and study full time without exhausting myself, my insurance agent explained that he couldn't take any action because I had demonstrated my ability to function normally by returning to school as a child. He informed me that the only way to receive assistance was to establish medically that my condition had significantly worsened.

By the end of 1992, my physiatrist conducted a medical assessment to justify the deterioration of my condition over time. I hired a lawyer whom I couldn't afford much, and who couldn't achieve much either in terms of assistance. In the spring of 1993, I received $600 from the insurance company, which I used to travel to the West Coast with some friends. Eventually, I became homeless and ended up in the USA.

Upon my return to Canada, my father took me to a specialist who had the bright idea to perform an X-ray. The results confirmed that I had been walking for an unknown period with a dislocated hip, explaining the systematic pain I endured. In August 1994, I underwent surgery to secure my hip in place, just above the pelvic socket. At the time, medical authorities were unable to explain how my hip had become dislocated, as it had gone unnoticed during my accident. Some suggested it might be a personal condition, a congenital issue from birth. However, after the operation, my orthopedist informed me that it was evident it was a post-trauma condition. I later asked him to document this in a report.

Thinking that I finally had the evidence needed to substantiate a relapse, I approached my insurance agent for assistance. Instead, I received a letter stating that the specialists had concluded that my issues were attributed to a personal condition. This was not true, of course, but since they had made their decision, I was left to prove otherwise.

In 1995, I sought the counsel of another attorney who referred me to a medical expert. They requested that I gather all the available medical records from the hospital archives where I had been treated following the accident. Our goal was to find evidence that my hip had become dislocated during the accident and not prior to it. However, we couldn't locate any mention of the hip in the records. There was only one X-ray of my pelvis, but it was difficult to discern my skeletal structure due to the substantial amount of blood in my body after my spleen had ruptured. We were left with no clues about the condition of my hip.

Due to my financial constraints and being on welfare, both my attorney and the specialist halted their efforts after determining that they had done all they could with the $1,000 allocated by the government for my case. Feeling discouraged and having exhausted all available options, I made the decision to abandon the pursuit of legal action against the government for their unfair decision. I resolved to continue following the same approach I had always adopted in my life, striving to do my best and seeking success through my own talents and efforts.

When I chose to enter into the waters of baptism, I placed my wavering faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, recognizing my own limitations in managing life, I leaned on the belief that Christ had the power to reshape my character and guide me toward personal improvement. My past sins weighed heavily on me, yet, in accordance with the promise, the Holy Spirit that enveloped me after my baptism brought a profound inner peace. Moreover, I received blessings of understanding and heightened spiritual awareness. My capacity for love and empathy expanded, and I maintained trust that, with God's assistance, I could attain success in life despite the challenges posed by my physical condition.

## 1 Nephi 4:4

> Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.

No one can compel another to change. People must choose to change for themselves; however, we can certainly exert influence and inspire others to change. This is the transformative work that Christ does within us. The Holy Spirit inspires followers of Christ to choose the right path. Individuals are then either transformed by the Spirit as they follow Christ, or not, if they choose not to do so. The Holy Spirit can indeed bring about transformation, but not without our willingness.

My missionary service was undeniably one of these transformative journeys that the Lord inspired me to embark upon. Through this experience, the Lord revealed to me that I had the capacity to become a better man, and I recognized that it was through His inspiration and grace that I had grown more like Him. It stands as one of the best decisions of my life. However, my family didn't initially view it the same way. I was going to leave work and family, and it scared them. I had to explain to my mother, father, and grandmother even, that I believed God had helped me secure a good job. Two years after my baptism, I was employed at the Bank of Montreal, initially as a phone agent and later as a clerk, handling transactions for customers and contributing to the enhancement of operational processes and services.

By 1998, I had completed two full years at the bank and had saved enough money to embark on a two-year mission. My close relationships and siblings were deeply concerned that I might lose a solid position and never have another opportunity like it. I hadn't finished my bachelor's degree, and my physical condition made it challenging for me to secure a good job or study full time. They attempted to dissuade me from going.

I assured my mother that since God had guided me to where I was at that point in my life, I was confident He would continue to guide me after my mission, especially after dedicating two years in His service. And indeed, He did, repeatedly, even until now, twenty-five years later. Now my close ones see that the hand of the Lord has blessed me throughout my life.

## 1 Nephi 4:5-6

> And it was by night... I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.
>
> And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.

I learned to rely on the Lord, much like Nephi did. Nephi's unwavering trust in divine guidance allowed him to be ready for any task the Lord asked of him. After my mission, I found myself at a crossroads, uncertain about my life's direction. Yet, I held firm to the belief that God would guide me, just as He had done so far throughout my journeyâfrom baptism to the end of my mission.

Flying back home, I encountered a man in the airplaneâa fellow traveler with a physical disability. He was sitting in a wheelchair next to me doing math calculations in a notebook. He caught my attention, not only due to our shared condition but also because of my interest in mathematics. Curious about his profession, I struck up a conversation. He revealed that he was an engineer. During my mission, I had met a software engineer who worked remotely, and it dawned on me that perhaps I could follow a similar path, since I was excellent in computer programming when I was a kid.

So back to Montreal, my roommate one day talked to me about a college program in computer programming he succeeded earlier and encouraged me to apply for admission. Which I did, passed the tests and got immediately admitted. I also went back at the Bank of Montreal and could get a job. About three weeks after getting back from my mission, I was working part time and studying part time. The Spirit encouraging me to pursue my studies. My plan was to do this for a time while I was figuring out which university program to go to eventually.

It went very well for a few months, but one day, listening to the church's general conference,

dimanche, le 2 fÃ©vrier 2020

hier ou avant hier, en retranscrivant mon journal de 1995, j'ai lu que j'avais fait un rÃªve Ã  l'Ã©poque dans lequel mon pÃ¨re me disait d'Ã©tudier en mathÃ©matiques industrielles.  je ne savais pas vraiment quelle direction prendre Ã  ce moment.  mathÃ©matiques industrielles n'est pas une discipline libellÃ©e comme tel Ã  l'universitÃ©.  j'ai mÃ©ditÃ© sur ce sujet depuis hier et j'ai rendu mon tÃ©moignage Ã  la Sainte-CÃ¨ne aujourd'hui surtout pour les jeunes, pour ne pas qu'ils dÃ©sespÃ¨rent.

je n'avais pas une trÃ¨s grande estime de moi en 1995.  j'avais alors 22 ou 23 ans.  je venais de subir une chirurgie Ã  la hanche et je marchais avec des bÃ©quilles.  je vivais sur l'aide sociale et je n'arrivais pas Ã  trouver un emploi adaptÃ© Ã  mes capacitÃ©s  trÃ¨s limitÃ©es.  je ne savais pas trop ce que je pourrais faire pour gagner ma vie Ã  cause des difficultÃ©s liÃ©es Ã  mon handicap.  j'avais essuyÃ© plusieurs Ã©checs.  les perspectives ne me semblaient pas trÃ¨s encourageantes.  j'Ã©tais douÃ© en mathÃ©matiques Ã  l'Ã©cole : c'Ã©tait ma matiÃ¨re forte au secondaire et au cÃ©gep.  j'ai donc cherchÃ© les diffÃ©rents programmes universitaires en mathÃ©matique, avec en tÃªte le rÃªve que j'avais fait.  on n'avait pas l'internet comme aujourd'hui et ce n'Ã©tait pas facile comme aujourd'hui pour obtenir l'information.  

je suis allÃ© chercher au bureau d'orientation les guides de programmes de diffÃ©rentes universitÃ©s et j'ai cherchÃ© ce qu'on offrait en mathÃ©matiques industrielles, mais je n'ai rien trouvÃ© de vraiment pertinent.  j'ai cru comprendre qu'Ã  l'UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke, le programme Ã©tait axÃ© vers l'industrie, mais sans savoir vraiment, c'Ã©tait difficile de me faire une idÃ©e claire de ce que je devais Ã©tudier.

je suis parti en mission 3 ans plus tard en 1998.  j'avais rÃ©ussi Ã  trouver un emploi Ã  la Banque de MontrÃ©al pour payer toutes mes dettes d'Ã©tudes et ramasser 10~000~\$ pour la mission.  le chemin pour me rendre jusque-lÃ  n'a pas Ã©tÃ© une petite affaire, je ne ferai donc pas maintenant le rÃ©cit de cette premiÃ¨re rÃ©ussite.  j'ai donc quittÃ© mon emploi pour la mission, au grand dÃ©sespoir de ma mÃ¨re et de mon pÃ¨re, qui s'inquiÃ©taient franchement pour mon avenir.  

en mission, j'avais rencontrÃ© un Ã©vÃªque qui travaillait de la maison au nord de l'Idaho.  il Ã©tait ingÃ©nieur informatique.  j'Ã©tais bon en informatique et je me disais que ce serait peut-Ãªtre une avenue pour moi.

dans le vol de retour de ma mission vers MontrÃ©al (mai 2000), j'Ã©tais assis Ã  cÃ´tÃ© d'un homme en chaise roulante qui faisait des mathÃ©matiques.  intÃ©ressÃ©, je lui ai demandÃ© quel Ã©tait son mÃ©tier et il m'a rÃ©pondu qu'il Ã©tait ingÃ©nieur.  c'Ã©tait pour moi trÃ¨s encourageant, comme un signe que je pourrais faire ce genre de travail.

de retour Ã  MontrÃ©al, je suis retournÃ© travailler rapidement Ã  la Banque de MontrÃ©al et j'ai commencÃ© des Ã©tudes collÃ©giales en informatique au CollÃ¨ge CDI Ã  la fin de l'annÃ©e 2000.  mon objectif Ã©tant Ã©ventuellement de me rendre Ã  l'universitÃ©; mais quand j'ai rÃ©alisÃ© que je perdais mon temps au collÃ¨ge, j'ai abandonnÃ© le programme. j'Ã©tais le meilleur de la cohorte, et je me disais que j'allais plutÃ´t m'inscrire Ã  l'universitÃ©.  j'ai appelÃ© la Polytechnique de MontrÃ©al pour leur demander si je pouvais m'inscrire Ã  leur programme de gÃ©nie informatique, mais on m'a affirmÃ© que je devais avoir fait mes Ã©tudes collÃ©giales en sciences pures.  j'avais fait seulement des mathÃ©matiques fortes au cÃ©gep.  on m'a fait comprendre que je n'avais pas ce qu'il fallait.

dÃ©Ã§u, mais pas dÃ©couragÃ©, j'ai donc abandonnÃ© l'idÃ©e d'Ã©tudier en informatique et je me suis inscrit Ã  Rimouski au baccalaurÃ©at en enseignement pour la rentrÃ© de l'automne 2001.  j'avais priÃ© fervemment en mission pour devenir instructeur de sÃ©minaire un jour et j'avais vraiment senti que PÃ¨re cÃ©leste m'entendait.  en lisant les informations du Church Educational System (Ã  ce moment lÃ , j'avais accÃ¨s Ã  l'internet), j'ai appris que pour devenir instructeur de sÃ©minaire, il fallait un baccalaurÃ©at dans une discipline quelconque pour pouvoir suivre la formation des instructeurs.  je me suis dit que puisque j'avais vraiment un talent pour enseigner dans l'Ãglise, je pouvais espÃ©rer devenir un bon enseignant.  j'ai choisi un programme d'enseignement pour les enfants en difficultÃ©.  mon objectif Ã©tait d'aider les enfants handicapÃ©s Ã  rÃ©ussir leurs Ã©tudes.

j'ai aimÃ© mes Ã©tudes en enseignement Ã  l'UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  Rimouski.  j'ai aimÃ© ma cohorte aussi. on faisait de belles activitÃ©s ensemble, mais je voyais souvent dans la cafÃ©tÃ©ria un groupe d'Ã©tudiants qui travaillaient ensemble leurs mathÃ©matiques.  c'Ã©tait un groupe trÃ¨s hÃ©tÃ©roclite et ils avaient l'air de bien s'entendre.  ils faisaient partie du baccalaurÃ©at en informatique.

Ã  la fin de mon premier stage en enseignement dans une Ã©cole primaire Ã  Matane, lors de ma 2e session, au printemps 2002, ma superviseure de stage m'a fortement dÃ©couragÃ© de prendre la direction de l'enseignement, Ã  cause de mon handicap et de mes difficultÃ©s Ã  me dÃ©placer.  elle m'a fait comprendre que je n'Ã©tais pas Ã  ma place dans une Ã©cole et j'ai surtout compris que ce serait difficile pour moi de travailler tous les jours dans une Ã©cole, et surtout de me faire accepter des autres enseignants, et encore plus des parents.  Ã§a m'a donnÃ© un coup.  je me souviens, j'Ã©tais dans l'autobus entre Matane et Rimouski, j'ai pensÃ© au baccalaurÃ©at en informatique et j'ai demandÃ© Ã  Dieu (en priÃ¨re dans mon cÅur) si c'Ã©tait pour moi une bonne idÃ©e d'Ã©tudier en informatique; l'Esprit est alors venu tout de suite me confirmer que c'Ã©tait la bonne direction Ã  prendre : j'ai senti dans ma poitrine une chaleur intense au cÅur qui me confirmait que c'Ã©tait le bon choix pour moi.  je connaissais trÃ¨s bien ce sentiment, cette Ã©motion divine qui m'a guidÃ© Ã  plusieurs reprises pour accepter l'Ãvangile, joindre l'Ãglise de JÃ©sus-Christ des Saints des Derniers Jours et choisir le chemin du disciple.

de retour Ã  Rimouski, je me suis renseignÃ© sur le programme en informatique et les prÃ©-requis pour m'y inscrire.  il me manquait seulement un cours de mathÃ©matique.  je suis allÃ© rencontrer le directeur du programme pour lui demander s'il accepterait de me crÃ©diter le premier cours de programmation, en vertu des cours que j'avais trÃ¨s bien rÃ©ussis au CollÃ¨ge CDI.  il m'a dit de m'inscrire au cours de programmation 2, qu'il donnait lui-mÃªme pendant l'Ã©tÃ©, en me disant que si je rÃ©ussissais le 2e cours, il n'avait aucun problÃ¨me Ã  me crÃ©diter le 1er.  le directeur qui Ã©tait-lÃ  Ã  l'Ã©poque se nommait : AndrÃ© Jacques.  il est devenu un vÃ©ritable ami par la suite.  

j'ai annoncÃ© Ã  mon directeur de programme en enseignement que j'abandonnais son programme et que je me dirigeais vers l'informatique.  il Ã©tait dÃ©vastÃ© car j'Ã©tais un bon Ã©lÃ¨ve.  il a tentÃ© de me dissuader et de ne pas Ã©couter cette enseignante qui avait supervisÃ© mon stage, mais l'Esprit avait Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s clair avec moi et ma dÃ©cision Ã©tait prise.

j'ai obtenu les meilleurs rÃ©sultats de la classe de programmation cet Ã©tÃ©-lÃ  et j'ai commencÃ© mes Ã©tudes au baccalaurÃ©at en informatique Ã  l'automne 2002, avec 2 cours de programmation d'avance.  sous les recommandations de mon nouveau directeur, j'ai pris un cours intensif de rattrapage en mathÃ©matiques, parce que mes cours avait Ã©tÃ© pris plusieurs annÃ©es auparavant.  

j'ai terminÃ© mon baccalaurÃ©at en 2005.  mon directeur m'a dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ© Ã  MontrÃ©al Ã  la fin du printemps pour faire mes Ã©tudes de maÃ®trise en informatique Ã  l'automne, Ã  l'UQÃM. mais je me suis fait opÃ©rÃ© la hanche en novembre et j'ai dÃ» abandonner mes Ã©tudes pour me consacrer Ã  ma rÃ©adaptation toute l'annÃ©e 2006.  je suis retournÃ© aux Ã©tudes Ã  l'hiver 2007, en quadriporteur.  

durant mes Ã©tudes de maÃ®trise, j'ai pris des cours de gÃ©nie logiciel qui m'ont Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s utiles par la suite dans ma carriÃ¨re.  ces cours, en plus de l'expertise que j'ai dÃ©veloppÃ©e pendant mes recherches, m'ont permis de toujours avoir un pied d'avance par rapport Ã  mes collÃ¨gues.  

une chose en amenant une autre, j'ai su dÃ©velopper, grÃ¢ce Ã  Dieu, une expertise remarquÃ©e par mes paires et par l'industrie en analyse et en architecture d'affaires.  je travaille maintenant sur des projets et des modÃ¨les pour comprendre et amÃ©liorer l'organisation au complet, pas seulement les projets informatiques.  

je discutais l'autre jour avec Michel qui habite dans l'immeuble.  on l'avait invitÃ© avec sa conjointe, Ã  venir regarder la vidÃ©o sur la nativitÃ© que l'Ãglise diffuse.  pendant la discussion, on a parlÃ© de ce que je faisais comme travail.  et on s'est rendus compte qu'on faisait le mÃªme mÃ©tier.  lui par contre, il a pris sa retraite.  c'est alors que je lui ai demandÃ©, par curiositÃ©, quelle formation avait-il suivie pour dÃ©buter sa carriÃ¨re dans ce domaine, parce que c'est un mÃ©tier assez rÃ©cent.  il m'a dit qu'il avait fait ses Ã©tudes en gÃ©nie industriel.  j'ai tout de suite fait le lien avec l'inspiration d'Ã©tudier les mathÃ©matiques industrielles que j'ai reÃ§ue en rÃªve dans les annÃ©es '90, et Ã§a m'a rassurÃ© par rapport au chemin professionnel que j'ai finalement choisi de prendre.

de plus, dans ma bÃ©nÃ©diction patriarcale, le Seigneur m'a rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© en 1995 que je serais Â« un organisateur Â».  Ã§a m'avait Ã©tonnÃ© vraiment beaucoup Ã  l'Ã©poque parce que j'avais l'impression d'Ãªtre tellement dÃ©sorganisÃ©.  j'ai toujours gardÃ© Ã  l'esprit cette prophÃ©tie et j'ai cherchÃ© Ã  m'amÃ©liorer continuellement Ã  l'Ãglise, Ã  la Banque, en mission, lors de mes Ã©tudes, au travail, etc.

le patriarche m'a bÃ©ni pour que je rÃ©ussisse :

	Sois fidÃ¨le et tu rÃ©sisteras aux tentations, tu seras pour tes frÃ¨res et sÅurs un guide, un organisateur. Combien seront Ã©tonnÃ©s de ton savoir.

cette prophÃ©tie est sur le point de s'accomplir complÃ¨tement.  je travaille maintenant pour aider Investissement QuÃ©bec Ã  clarifier ses opÃ©rations, son modÃ¨le d'affaires, ses rÃ¨gles, ses politiques et ses opÃ©rations.  on a formÃ© une Ã©quipe d'architecture et d'analyse d'affaires en janvier.  je vais aider Ã  les former.  mon objectif est de continuer de m'instruire dans les meilleurs livres et les meilleures pratiques.  

le Seigneur m'a guidÃ© toutes ces annÃ©es.  il m'a pris par la main et il m'a ramenÃ© Ã  plusieurs reprises sur le chemin qu'il a prÃ©vu pour moi, dÃ¨s la fondation du monde.  je suis en train de rÃ©aliser son dessein.  c'est encourageant pour moi de voir que je suis toujours sur son chemin et aussi de voir que malgrÃ© mes dÃ©sirs et mes Ã©garements, ou mes faiblesses, mes empÃªchements et les alÃ©as de la vie, les persÃ©cutions, la maladie, le handicap : il a le pouvoir, l'intelligence et la puissance pour me garder sur le chemin de la rÃ©ussite et du salut.

j'ai donc dit aux jeunes ce matin dans mon tÃ©moignage de ne jamais dÃ©sespÃ©rer et de faire confiance au Seigneur.  il nous prends par la main et nous mÃ¨ne lÃ  oÃ¹ il veut que nous soyons.  je les ai exhortÃ© Ã  rester fidÃ¨les et Ã  faire confiance Ã  Dieu parce qu'il a l'intention de faire tout pour nous afin de rÃ©ussir notre vie.  

ce n'est pas facile de comprendre et de voir clairement la direction Ã  prendre dans sa vie.  la bonne information ne nous vient pas toujours au moment oÃ¹ nous en avons besoin; le dÃ©couragement nous paralyse parfois; l'adversitÃ© nous empÃªche mÃªme de faire la volontÃ© de Dieu, ou le doute; mais Dieu a ses mains tendus pour nous ramener et nous aider Ã  rÃ©ussir.

j'ai donc pleinement confiance en Ã©tudiant ma vie que PÃ¨re cÃ©leste saura certainement me guider jusque dans la vie Ã©ternelle : mÃªme chose pour les jeunes.

## 1 Nephi 4:7-8

> Nevertheless I went forth...
>
> ... and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken with wine.
>
> And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.

Now this is the right attitude to have when things seem hard to accomplish. Have faith in the Lord.
