***Likening the first chapter of the first book of Nephi***


## 1 Nephi 1:1

> I, NEPHI, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favoured of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

My dad isn't a prophet like Nephi's dad, but he taught me many good things. One thing he taught me is to never be ashamed of who I am, regardless of what others may think. Another thing he taught me is the importance of fighting for life.

Like Nephi, I have also seen many afflictions in my life because of a handicap --- I was hit by a car when I was seven years old. Because of the accident, I went into a coma for several days and was paralyzed for several months. My right hip was dislocated and my nervous system was severely damaged. Every movement requires a lot of effort on my part, and I need to concentrate almost all the time to send the right messages to my limbs when moving and even to relax them.

For me, normal things in life become quickly great challenges. But that didn't stop me from serving a two-year mission, getting a bachelor's degree in computer science, a master's degree, marrying a wonderful girl, and raising a family. I have tried most of my life to serve others and work valiantly. I have been sustained by the Spirit of God.

My parents taught me to serve and work regardless of my condition. I am very grateful for that. I feel the same way as Nephi did about the goodness of God. The love of God has warmed my heart since my baptism, when I received the gift of the Holy Ghost. He has stayed with me since and accompanied me as a good friend throughout all my days. So, I also know of the goodness of God and his kindness and mercy. His mysteries are made known to me through the Holy Spirit and the prophets, so I make a record of my testimony, just as Nephi did. It has been an amazing experience to compare his testimony to mine.

## 1 Nephi 1:2

> Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians. 
{: style="text-align: left"}

The entire Book of Mormon was written in the language of Nephi's father, which is later called Reformed Egyptian by Moroni, a Nephite prophet (see [Mormon 9:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=32#p31)). This was not their original Hebrew language, but rather a different tongue spoken and passed down from one generation to the next among the Nephites (it may have also been spoken among the Jews). We know from this verse that it was spoken in Jerusalem at least by some, as Moroni wrote that it was the language of his father.

I, myself, do not write my book in the language of my father --- for he speaks French, as does our whole family (French is spoken in Quebec) --- but rather in the language of the Americans, who could be compared to the Egyptians of the time for us. The Americans are, in a sense, like the Egyptians were to the Jews in 600 B.C. The Jews conducted trade and commerce with the Egyptians at that time, as the rest of the known world would do. I suppose the language of the Egyptians became their business language, just as English has become the common tongue in the economic world today. Therefore, it is as if I am writing my record in the Egyptian tongue of our time. It is also a better investment, as it is likely that the whole world will continue speaking English for a long time.

I don't know about the future of French in Quebec, but I will certainly pass this language down to my children. It is strange to think that a language could disappear from the face of the earth, but that is exactly what happened to the Reformed Egyptian spoken by the Nephites. It disappeared with them a thousand years after their arrival in America. Who knows, French-speaking people in America may face the same fate someday. So, I may one day translate this book into French, or write another book in French. 

## 1 Nephi 1:3

> And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge. 
{: style="text-align: left"}

Nephi's words give me confidence in the truth of what he wrote, and his honesty and the feelings I have while reading his account lead me to trust that he spoke truthfully about his experiences. I, like Nephi and the other authors of the Book of Mormon, declare that the book I am now writing is true. I promise the reader that I will always be truthful and as specific and honest as possible in the things I relate in this record. My desire is to bear good fruit, and I know the only way to do that is to give a pure testimony of the things the Almighty has done for me. The things you will read in this book are true. The Spirit of God will testify to your heart if I speak the truth, just as he does for the words of the prophets. I do not claim to be a prophet, but I do speak the truth. It is an unchangeable law that God will always help his children discern truth from error, as long as they live a righteous life.

## 1 Nephi 1:4
> ... and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.
{: style="text-align: left"}

Though it may sound pathetic, the Lord God has always done the same: he sends out many warnings before his fury comes down on the children of men.

This was around 600 B.C., and we know that the Babylonians eventually ravaged Jerusalem as foretold by the prophets. Lehi, the father of Nephi, was one of those prophets sent by God to warn the people of Jerusalem before the massacre came.

Today, over 50,000 personal representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ are sent all over the world to raise another voice of warning to the nations of the earth. I have been one of them, and I continue to warn my neighbors and my family against wickedness and iniquity. The Lord God is coming soon, and with him his indignation will burn the hearts of the wicked.

We, elders of Israel, are sent around the globe to gather his sheep in safety before the Second Coming of Christ. We are sent to ask the people everywhere to prepare and repent before the great day of the Lord comes, when he will destroy all wickedness, as God did for the people of Israel. While allowing them to be destroyed many times because of their wickedness, he will do the same to all the nations of the earth, as Isaiah and other prophets warned us. Our task is to gather whoever will come to the God of Israel in safety into Zion --- a very safe and blessed place that is, for now, wherever the followers of Christ are assembled in his true church.

We also know, because of Nephi's prophecies, that Zion will come out from the hearts of the children of men after the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. This is the great vision rooted in our hearts when we come to your door to ask you, people of all nations, at least to listen to the message we bring to you, and to test with prayer and earnestness if it may be true.

## 1 Nephi 1:5

> Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. 
{: style="text-align: left"}

I believe this is one of the most beautiful scriptures. Lehi prayed with all his heart on behalf of his people. What a wonderful scene! I see myself in a similar way, pleading to God for the people of Montreal, as a new member of the Church of Jesus Christ, and again on my mission for the people of North Idaho and West Montana. I have prayed for my family and friends many times with tears in my eyes and an aching heart. I see Nephi also in the same manner ([2 Nephi 33:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=3#2)), as well as Alma ([Alma 31:24-26, 34-36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=24-26,34-36#p23)), Mormon ([Mormon 6:16-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6?lang=eng&id=16-20#p15); [Moroni 9:20-22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=20-22#p19)), the brother of Jared ([Ether 1:34-39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=34-39#p33)), Joseph Smith ([D&C 21:7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21?lang=eng&id=7-8#p6)), and of course Jesus on many occasions ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-13#8); [John 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17?lang=eng); [Luke 23:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/23?lang=eng&id=34#p33); [3 Nephi 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=15-17#p14)).

What motivates such an outgoing desire of the heart? I believe it is true love. It gave Christ the strength to sustain an incomprehensible agony in Gethsemane. It gives a mother the courage to keep giving of herself, even when exhausted by the heat of the day.

I also pray for my people, especially for my own family, continually asking God to forgive them and myself, and to find a way to bring the precious gift of eternal life to their souls, if they dare to receive such a blessing. This is where all my hopes go, and it keeps me going. I continue to serve and live for that. I hope and pray and live to receive eternal life one day, not only for myself, but for my posterity, my extended family, all my ancestors, and the rest of the world, as many as will desire it. I deeply desire it, and it pushes me to keep writing and to continue serving in the priesthood of God.


## 1 Nephi 1:6

> And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. 
{: style="text-align: left"}

I had a similar experience with the fire of God in 1994, as I sat on a wood bench on a hill in the town of Matane, Canada. As I watched the sunset over the sea and contemplated the colors of the sky, I remembered another sunset I had seen earlier in 1992 on an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence Golf. I felt then deeply sad as the sun disappeared below the horizon, as if I was losing all hope of happiness. I had just lost all hope of love with a dear girlfriend and believed I had lost everything with the setting of the sun that evening. I sobbed with a broken heart while friends watched over me in silence.

However, as I saw the beautiful colored sky after the sun had disappeared, it was like a message to me that the sun and all the happiness it represented would still be there the next day. Even though it was out of sight, the sun was telling me that it was still there. This gave me hope and I trusted that there would be hapiness for me in the future. 

The memory of that emotional moment was what sparked everything. Prior to the vision I am about to tell, I had spent the night with some of those same friends, including the girlfriend I cherished so much. We stayed up all night in a friend's cabin, listening to music and having conversations. During the night, I was filled with a wonderful feeling of peace and love. My spirit felt so good and joyful. The music I heard that night still echoes within me with rays of happiness. It felt as if I understood everything about life and people. It was one of those rare moments in my life when my heart felt eternal.

We watched the glorious sun rise early that morning with the golden light over the fields. We had crepes together for breakfast, and then we went to bed. I kissed my dear friend on the forehead before she fell asleep, and then I went to bed thinking about the simplicity of that moment. I was happy to be her friend and loved her in that way, as a dear friend. I lay in bed, savoring and lingering on the joy I had. Needless to say, I didn't get any sleep that morning.

All of these memories came back to me later in the same day as I watched the sun disappear into the St. Lawrence River and the sky turn red and then purple. I was alone, thinking about all of these things when I was caught up in a vision.

I remembered many sunrises and sunsets. It seemed as if all the days between the sunset on the island and the one in Matane had passed by in an instant. That feeling of eternity I had experienced earlier returned to me again, but even more intensely. It was a powerful impression. I felt as if I was eternal again and was caught up in an even higher vision. Time no longer existed and neither did space. I was standing in spirit high above the planets and even above time. Perhaps this is what the prophets called the heavens. I saw two Men standing afar off, and while I was looking at them from afar, a personage appeared in front of me smiling radiantly. He seemed like a man like myself, but with infinite power and great holiness. As he smiled, I could perceive the purity of his thoughts and desires. For a very short moment, due to my pride, I looked down on him as I would a child, but the power of his majesty and the strength of his countenance prevented me from considering him as a child. I saw the glory of a god mixed with the meekness of a pure child. These two concepts were hard to reconcile in my mind. I was afraid to offend the being I had in front of me. I also knew he could see within my heart. This is when I started to feel ashamed of myself. Then I saw the fire of his glory like a flaming sword turning around him. I saw the strength and heat of this invisible fire coming from the holiness of his heart. I knew that I couldn't possibly stand in this fire and would be destroyed if I were to stand in his presence. So I was forced to bow and leave his presence.

The vision vanished. I was still sitting on the wood bench I mentioned earlier. Some kids came up the hill where I was and said something like, "What on earth did this man do to have such a troubled look on his face?" It surprised me to hear this because I considered the vision I just had as a glorious moment.

I took a little time to come back to my senses and went back to my mother's place. I was all happy until I arrived there. As soon as I passed through the door, while my mother was greeting me, I felt the same shame that I had felt in the celestial fire, and I began to shake excessively inside my body and soul. I told my mom I wasn't feeling too good and thought I might have the flu or something. My mom then said she wasn't feeling too good either. It was Easter and her sister was supposed to come and take us to her place, but we canceled the visit.

I continued to feel that great malaise for a few days. I didn't understand what it was. I tried to read the Bible to feel better, as I would do at home in Montreal with the Book of Mormon when I felt bad, but the words I read in the Bible kept reminding me of my sins, and I felt even worse than before.

I had more remorse of conscience than ever before in my life. I had lost all the joy I had previously experienced and was frustrated and angry about it. I wanted to repair the bad things I had done, but they were things I couldn't repair, especially one person I had deeply offended. She was long gone and there was no way to find her. I wrote a letter hoping to find a way to send it to her someday.

During the week that followed, I kept seeing a huge eye in the gray sky looking at me all the time whenever I was outside. I had lost all joy and felt ashamed. I started praying that I could just hear some beautiful music that could feed my soul again, like the music I heard on that night with my friends.

It was only a few days later, when I remembered the missionaries who came to visit me at my house and the feelings of holy love we shared together, that I began to feel better and find hope again. But that's another story that I will tell later.


## 1 Nephi 1:7

> And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen.
{: style="text-align: left"}

After what I considered to be a very marvelous vision, I was literally overcome with the Spirit and the things which I had seen. I did shake and tremble excessively for some days after. My mind could only focuse on the corruption within me. 

Moses said something very interesting right after he had met with God and had found himself without strength for a very long time: "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed." ([Moses 1:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=10#p9)) Similarly, I didn't think much of myself, and for the first time in my life, I began to feel the desire to repent of my wrongdoings. I began to believe that I had done wrong, feeling great remorse.

There is another passage in the Bible where a similar strange thing happens to Daniel after seeing the Lord of hosts: "Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength." ([Daniel 10:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/10?lang=eng&id=8#p7)) 

I quote these verses to help understand what happens when one feels the righteousness of the Lord, and also to reassure myself of the truth of what I have seen and felt.

At the time of this event, I wasn't a member of God's church yet and I had no priesthood or special calling. I didn't have any gift from the Holy Ghost confirmed upon my head. I was just a young man without knowledge and hope.

A year prior to this event, in the summer of 1993, I had prayed once and fasted almost three days to see God. I wanted to see the same thing as the prophet Joseph Smith did, but at that time, I had no vision, even though I received a revelation regarding the purpose of life. I will tell this story later.

In fact, Joseph Smith's testimony also confirms this very particular lack of strength. He wrote, after telling of his first vision of God the Father and his Beloved Son: "When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother enquired what the matter was." ([Joseph Smith History 1:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=20#p19)) 

I asked my mother a few times if she remembered this particular Easter, and each time she said yes. She also felt this strange malaise and therefore cannot forget it. I believe that when the Spirit of God imparts truths to your soul, you can never forget them.

## 1 Nephi 1:8

> And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.
{: style="text-align: left"}

I often thought about the vision I had and the being I saw in it. I wondered if it was possible that I saw God, since I didn't consider myself a holy man. Years later, I prayed to ask the Lord whom I saw in that vision, and the Spirit whispered to me that he was a cherubim. Then I understood that the fire I felt around him was like a flaming sword guarding me from coming too close to God because of my impurities. I really felt that the natural part of me couldn't possibly stay there any longer.

There is something that has always caught my attention in the record of Nephi about his father's vision: he said that his father "thought he saw God". What does that mean? Did he see Him or not? For a long time, I also thought that I had seen God, not knowing if I really saw Him. But I saw Him in heaven, being caught up in the Spirit, even though I wasn't a fully righteous man, and not being a prophet or a priest. I was full of pride and I had made some real mistakes, so how could I have had such a vision? Nonetheless, I always believed that this vision was from God because it helped me feel a desire to repent.

I found something in the scriptures that helped me. Alma tells his son about a similar experience he had: "Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels" ([Alma 36:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=22#p21)). Alma also wasn't a righteous man when he had the vision he refers to. In fact, "he was going about to destroy the church of God" ([Mosiah 27:8-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=8-10#p7)). Knowing this helps me believe that a wicked man like I was at the time could have seen such things as I really did. Was I wicked or just ignorant? Well, a little of both. Alma's father was praying and fasting for him, so I also fasted and prayed, almost a year prior to that event, because I wanted to see God like the prophet Joseph Smith did. Not as a sign to believe in Him, but because I believed Joseph's vision was true and I wanted to meet my Father in heaven too.

Now I would like to focus on a common word used by both prophets, Lehi and Alma, in regards to their similar visions: they both *thought* they saw God. Why is that? Why did they say they thought they saw God? Let me suggest the same thing as Moses did: he explained that he saw God with his spiritual eyes, not his physical eyes. If it had been otherwise, he would have withered and died in God's presence. "But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him." ([Moses 1:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=11#p10))

I suspect that is also the reason the other witnesses, Lehi and Alma, said they thought they saw God. For the same reason, I always *thought* I have seen Him too, because I saw Him in a vision with my spiritual eyes, not my physical ones.

There seemed to have been different kinds of visions of God. Some have seen Him face to face as a man sees another (see [Moses 1:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=31#p30); [Numbers 12:3-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/12?lang=eng&id=3-8#p2); [Genesis 32:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/32?lang=eng&id=30#p29); [1 Kings 11:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/11?lang=eng&id=9#8); [Ether 3:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=13#p12); [Abraham 3:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=11#p10); [Joseph Smith---History 1:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=17#p16)). I don't make distinction here between the appearances of the Father or the Son ([John 14:6-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=6-9#p5)). Others, like Lehi, have seen God in a spiritual vision (see [Ezekiel 1:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/1?lang=eng&id=1); [Acts 7:55-56](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/7?lang=eng&id=55-56#p54); [Alma 19:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=13#p12); [Alma 36:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=22#21); [Doctrine and Covenants 76:11-12, 19-22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=11-12,19-22#p10); [1 Nephi 11:1, 18-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=1,18-24)).

I, too, saw God and His Son from afar in a vision, and a cherubim right in front of me, despite my unworthiness, being carried away spirtually high above this earthly world. I give my testimony, along with the countless witnesses of His glory and holiness, that I know for sure that there is a God in heaven.
