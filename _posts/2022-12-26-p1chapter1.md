***Likening the first chapter of the first book of Nephi***


## 1 Nephi 1:1

> I, NEPHI, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favoured of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

My dad isn't a prophet like Nephi's dad, but he taught me many good things. One thing he taught me is to never be ashamed of who I am, regardless of what others may think. Another thing he taught me is the importance of fighting for life.

Like Nephi, I have also seen many afflictions in my life because of a handicap --- I was hit by a car when I was seven years old. Because of the accident, I went into a coma for several days and was paralyzed for several months. My right hip was dislocated and my nervous system was severely damaged. Every movement requires a lot of effort on my part, and I need to concentrate almost all the time to send the right messages to my limbs when moving and even to relax them.

For me, normal things in life become quickly great challenges. But that didn't stop me from serving a two-year mission, getting a bachelor's degree in computer science, a master's degree, marrying a wonderful girl, and raising a family. I have tried most of my life to serve others and work valiantly. I have been sustained by the Spirit of God.

My parents taught me to serve and work regardless of my condition. I am very grateful for that. I feel the same way as Nephi did about the goodness of God. The love of God has warmed my heart since my baptism, when I received the gift of the Holy Ghost. He has stayed with me since and accompanied me as a good friend throughout all my days. So, I also know of the goodness of God and his kindness and mercy. His mysteries are made known to me through the Holy Spirit and the prophets, so I make a record of my testimony, just as Nephi did. It has been an amazing experience to compare his testimony to mine.

## 1 Nephi 1:2

> Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians. 
{: style="text-align: left"}

The entire Book of Mormon was written in the language of Nephi's father, which is later called Reformed Egyptian by Moroni, a Nephite prophet (see [Mormon 9:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=32#p31)). This was not their original Hebrew language, but rather a different tongue spoken and passed down from one generation to the next among the Nephites (it may have also been spoken among the Jews). We know from this verse that it was spoken in Jerusalem at least by some, as Moroni wrote that it was the language of his father.

I, myself, do not write my book in the language of my father --- for he speaks French, as does our whole family (French is spoken in Quebec) --- but rather in the language of the Americans, who could be compared to the Egyptians of the time for us. The Americans are, in a sense, like the Egyptians were to the Jews in 600 B.C. The Jews conducted trade and commerce with the Egyptians at that time, as the rest of the known world would do. I suppose the language of the Egyptians became their business language, just as English has become the common tongue in the economic world today. Therefore, it is as if I am writing my record in the Egyptian tongue of our time. It is also a better investment, as it is likely that the whole world will continue speaking English for a long time.

I don't know about the future of French in Quebec, but I will certainly pass this language down to my children. It is strange to think that a language could disappear from the face of the earth, but that is exactly what happened to the Reformed Egyptian spoken by the Nephites. It disappeared with them a thousand years after their arrival in America. Who knows, French-speaking people in America may face the same fate someday. So, I may one day translate this book into French, or write another book in French. 

## 1 Nephi 1:3

> And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge. 
{: style="text-align: left"}

Nephi's words give me confidence in the truth of what he wrote, and his honesty and the feelings I have while reading his account lead me to trust that he spoke truthfully about his experiences. I, like Nephi and the other authors of the Book of Mormon, declare that the book I am now writing is true. I promise the reader that I will always be truthful and as specific and honest as possible in the things I relate in this record. My desire is to bear good fruit, and I know the only way to do that is to give a pure testimony of the things the Almighty has done for me. The things you will read in this book are true. The Spirit of God will testify to your heart if I speak the truth, just as he does for the words of the prophets. I do not claim to be a prophet, but I do speak the truth. It is an unchangeable law that God will always help his children discern truth from error, as long as they live a righteous life.

## 1 Nephi 1:4
> ... and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.
{: style="text-align: left"}

Though it may sound pathetic, the Lord God has always done the same: he sends out many warnings before his fury comes down on the children of men.

This was around 600 B.C., and we know that the Babylonians eventually ravaged Jerusalem as foretold by the prophets. Lehi, the father of Nephi, was one of those prophets sent by God to warn the people of Jerusalem before the massacre came.

Today, over 50,000 personal representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ are sent all over the world to raise another voice of warning to the nations of the earth. I have been one of them, and I continue to warn my neighbors and my family against wickedness and iniquity. The Lord God is coming soon, and with him his indignation will burn the hearts of the wicked.

We, elders of Israel, are sent around the globe to gather his sheep in safety before the Second Coming of Christ. We are sent to ask the people everywhere to prepare and repent before the great day of the Lord comes, when he will destroy all wickedness, as God did for the people of Israel. While allowing them to be destroyed many times because of their wickedness, he will do the same to all the nations of the earth, as Isaiah and other prophets warned us. Our task is to gather whoever will come to the God of Israel in safety into Zion --- a very safe and blessed place that is, for now, wherever the followers of Christ are assembled in his true church.

We also know, because of Nephi's prophecies, that Zion will come out from the hearts of the children of men after the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. This is the great vision rooted in our hearts when we come to your door to ask you, people of all nations, at least to listen to the message we bring to you, and to test with prayer and earnestness if it may be true.

## 1 Nephi 1:5

> Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. 
{: style="text-align: left"}

I believe this is one of the most beautiful scriptures. Lehi prayed with all his heart on behalf of his people. What a wonderful scene! I see myself in a similar way, pleading to God for the people of Montreal, as a new member of the Church of Jesus Christ, and again on my mission for the people of North Idaho and West Montana. I have prayed for my family and friends many times with tears in my eyes and an aching heart. I see Nephi also in the same manner ([2 Nephi 33:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=3#2)), as well as Alma ([Alma 31:24-26, 34-36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=24-26,34-36#p23)), Mormon ([Mormon 6:16-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6?lang=eng&id=16-20#p15); [Moroni 9:20-22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=20-22#p19)), the brother of Jared ([Ether 1:34-39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=34-39#p33)), Joseph Smith ([D&C 21:7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21?lang=eng&id=7-8#p6)), and of course Jesus on many occasions ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-13#8); [John 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17?lang=eng); [Luke 23:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/23?lang=eng&id=34#p33); [3 Nephi 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=15-17#p14)).

What motivates such an outgoing desire of the heart? I believe it is true love. It gave Christ the strength to sustain an incomprehensible agony in Gethsemane. It gives a mother the courage to keep giving of herself, even when exhausted by the heat of the day.

I also pray for my people, especially for my own family, continually asking God to forgive them and myself, and to find a way to bring the precious gift of eternal life to their souls, if they dare to receive such a blessing. This is where all my hopes go, and it keeps me going. I continue to serve and live for that. I hope and pray and live to receive eternal life one day, not only for myself, but for my posterity, my extended family, all my ancestors, and the rest of the world, as many as will desire it. I deeply desire it, and it pushes me to keep writing and to continue serving in the priesthood of God.
