The expression *likening the Book of Mormon* describes the process of comparing and connecting the teachings and stories in the Book of Mormon to one's own personal experiences and understanding. This is a common practice for many readers of the Book of Mormon, as it can help to better understand and apply the teachings in their own lives. It can also help to build a stronger sense of personal testimony and connection to the teachings of the gospel.
